# Sentiment-Analysis-DataScienceLab-ML-project

The repo contains:
- the .py script of the single solution 
- the .pdf report
- two .csv files (developmentImproved.csv and evaluationImproved.csv)
(The improved dataset after a semi-manual preprocessing as described in the report)

Remark: the program uses a .txt file that is not present in this .zip ,
but can be generated calling the printStopwordsFile() and passing its
relative path to the getStopwordslist() method
